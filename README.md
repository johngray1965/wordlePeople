# wordlePeople
A test app for room, paging3, flow, and recyclerView

WorldePeople are an alien race.  They have a first, last, and middle names, which are curisouly always five letters long.  They are one of three colors Red, Green, or Blue.  They have four genders North, South, East and West.  Nobody knows how that works.

To use the app, first select import from the menu.  That'll prompt you for the number of items to import, and randomly generate WordlePeople, and put them in a room database.  The importing takes something under 1 sec/1000 items.

You'll see a list of the WorldPeople with a square to represent their color and text fields for the name and gender. 

From the main menu you can filter the WordlePeople by color and gender.

It works well with 50,000 items, it does not work well for 100,000 items.
