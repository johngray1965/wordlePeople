# wordlePeople
A test app for room, paging3, flow, and recyclerView

WorldePeople are an alien race.  They have a first, last, and middle names, which are curisouly always five letters long.  They are one of three colors Red, Green, or Blue.  They have four genders North, South, East and West.  Nobody knows how that works.

To use the app, first select import from the menu.  That'll import 100,000 randomly generated WordlePeople, and put them in a room database.  That'll take a few seconds.

You'll see a list of the WorldPeople with a square to represent their color and text fields for the name and gender. (and a delete button that doesn't do anything at the time of this writing).

From the main menu you can filter the WordlePeople by color and gender.
